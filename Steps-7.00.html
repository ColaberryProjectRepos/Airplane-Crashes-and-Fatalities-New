Some steps that can be taken to reduce the number of fatalities in an airplane crash include:</div><ol style="list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0.65em 0px 0.9em; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">On June 2nd, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, suffered a catastrophic failure of its tail-mounted engine, resulting in the deaths of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">111</span>&nbsp;people. The accident was caused by a design defect in the engine's fan disk, which was not identified during maintenance. My suggestion advancements in technology, such as condition-based maintenance and predictive maintenance, can help to identify and address potential issues before they occur.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">On March 12th, 1977, KLM Flight 4805, a McDonnell Douglas DC-8, collided with a Pan Am Boeing 747 on the runway at Tenerife, Canary Islands, killing all&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">583</span>&nbsp;people on board both aircrafts, in what is considered the deadliest aviation accident in history. The accident was caused by several factors, including a poor communication between the airport control tower and the KLM flight crew.&nbsp; My suggestion will be&nbsp; regular communication drills and simulations can help to identify and address any communication issues before they occur in real-world situations, and improve the communication process.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">On June 1st, 2009, Air France Flight 447, an Airbus A330, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean during a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">228</span>&nbsp;people on board. The cause of the crash was determined to be a combination of factors, including a failure of the plane's pitot tubes, which resulted in an incorrect airspeed reading, and the pilot's inadequate response to the resulting stall warning. To avoid this kind of accidents my suggestion improving weather forecasting and warning systems to help pilots avoid flying into adverse weather conditions</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">On August 2nd, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747, suffered a catastrophic failure of its tail section, resulting in the deaths of all&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">15</span>&nbsp;crew members and&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">505</span>&nbsp;passengers. The crash&nbsp; determined to be a design defect in the aircraft's tail, which was not properly repaired during maintenance. My suggestion for this kind of accidents the best you can do is conducting research into new technologies and materials that can improve the safety of aircraft, such as stronger and more lightweight materials for aircraft construction.</li></ol><p style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><a class="attachment__link unstyled" target="_blank" href="https://storage.3.basecamp.com/3945211/blobs/316a4d78-9227-11ed-93b1-f28505eae2ff/download/image.png" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: inherit; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; word-break: normal; max-width: 100%; outline: 0px; font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"></a></p><div class="attachment__frame" style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; max-width: 100%; border: 1px solid var(--color-shade-15); padding: 1px; margin: 0px;"><div class="inline_media_width_constraint" style="box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100%; margin: 0px; width: 684px;"><div class="inline_media_height_constraint" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; position: relative; padding-top: 346.991px;"><div class="inline_media_box" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; width: 683.993px; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1139/23/3.jpg"><br></div></div></div></div>
